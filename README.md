### Description

This is a great battery-backed real time clock (RTC) that allows your microcontroller project to keep track of time even if it is reprogrammed, or if the power is lost. Perfect for datalogging, clock-building, time stamping, timers and alarms, etc. Equipped with PCF8523 RTC - it can run from 3.3V or 5V power & logic!

Works great with an Arduino using our RTC library, with CircuitPython or with a Raspberry Pi (or similar single board linux computer)

* PCB & header are included
* Plugs into any breadboard, or you can use wires
* Two mounting holes
* Will keep time for 5 years or more

**Note: This product does not come with a CR1220 coin cell battery. We recommend you purchase a coin cell battery to use with this product.**

The PCF8523 is simple and inexpensive but not a high precision device. It may lose or gain up to 2 seconds a day. For a high-precision, temperature compensated alternative, please check out the DS3231 precision RTC. If you need a DS1307 for compatibility reasons, check out our DS1307 RTC breakout
